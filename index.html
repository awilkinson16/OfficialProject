      <p1>Our DoggyLocks doggy door is the safest way to keep your house safe and your dog happy. A simple sensor detects when your dog wants to go outside and opens the door. When your dog is safely back inside it locks it again to stop unwanted visitors.</p>
      <p>As well as that on our website you can log in and monitor how often your dog has left the house and even whether your dog is inside or outside</p>
      <br>
      <p>Contact us at DoggyLocks@homtail.com to order yours today and a member of our team will contact you with a customised plan that works for you.</p>
